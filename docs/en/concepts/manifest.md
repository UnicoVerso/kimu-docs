# The KIMU Manifesto

> _"Not just code, but digital poetry.  
> Not just function, but intention.  
> Not just interface, but space to inhabit."_

## We believe...

1. **We believe in intentional minimalism.**  
   _Less is more when every element has a purpose._

2. **We believe in expressive freedom.**  
   _Technology should amplify creativity, not confine it._

3. **We believe in open standards.**  
   _The web belongs to everyone; we build on shared foundations._

4. **We believe in lightness as a virtue.**  
   _An interface that breathes lets the user breathe as well._

5. **We believe in organic modularity.**  
   _Components growing together like a natural ecosystem._

6. **We believe in code as craftsmanship.**  
   _Every line written with awareness and care._

7. **We believe in accessibility as a right.**  
   _Interfaces belong to everyone, without exceptions._

8. **We believe in transparency as a value.**  
   _Open code is honest code._

## We commit to...

1. **Keep KIMU as light as a feather.**  
   _Every byte must earn its right to exist._

2. **Favor native web standards.**  
   _We prefer extending rather than reinventing._

3. **Cultivate a modular ecosystem.**  
   _Independent components that harmonize together._

4. **Design for intention.**  
   _Every interface is a dialogue, not a monologue._

5. **Respect the developer's creative control.**  
   _We offer tools, not impositions._

6. **Evolve with care and awareness.**  
   _Grow without becoming heavy, improve without complicating._

7. **Create meaningful digital spaces.**  
   _Transform interaction into experience._

8. **Build with the community, for the community.**  
   _KIMU belongs to those who use it and those who shape it._
