# KIMU vs Other Frameworks

> _"It's not about competition, but about conscious choice for the right tool at the right time."_

KIMU was not created to replace or compete with large generalist frameworks, but to offer an alternative in specific contexts. This comparison aims to help you understand when KIMU might be the best choice for your project.

## Conceptual Comparison Table

| Aspect | KIMU | Traditional Frameworks | Micro-Frameworks |
|---------|------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Philosophy** | Poetic and intentional minimalism | Complete and structured ecosystem | Pragmatism and lightness |
| **Size** | Ultra-lightweight (~20kB) | Often heavy (>100kB) | Lightweight (20-50kB) |
| **Approach** | Modular with on-demand extensions | Monolithic with integrated features | Focused on essential functions |
| **Learning curve** | Intuitive, based on web standards | Steep, requires specific knowledge | Variable, often simple |
| **Customization** | Maximum expressive freedom | Limited by framework patterns | Moderate, plugin-based |
| **Control** | Total over code and rendering | Partial, mediated by the framework | Good, with compromises |

## When to prefer KIMU

KIMU is the ideal choice when:

- **You seek lightness**: Projects that need to work in environments with limited resources
- **You value web standards**: You don't want to be bound to proprietary syntax or paradigms
- **You desire total flexibility**: You want to decide exactly what and how to implement
- **You appreciate modularity**: You prefer to load only what you need, when you need it
- **You have a creative soul**: You see interface not just as functionality, but as expression

## When to consider alternatives

Other frameworks might be more suitable when:

- **You have tight deadlines**: Projects with immediate deadlines that require "battery-included" solutions
- **You have very large teams**: Contexts where forced standardization is an advantage
- **You're developing complex applications**: Enterprise projects with extremely articulated requirements
- **You're looking for ready-made solutions**: Situations where you don't want to reinvent the wheel

## Our position

> _"KIMU doesn't aspire to be the tool for every problem,_  
> _but the perfect tool for those seeking poetry in code,_  
> _intention in interface,_  
> _and meaning in technology."_

We believe that diversity of approaches in the development world is valuable. KIMU represents a distinct voice in this chorus, offering an alternative to those seeking a more essential, poetic, and intentional approach to creating digital interfaces.
