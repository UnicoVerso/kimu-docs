# Frequently Asked Questions about KIMU

> _"Questions help us explore the territory of knowledge more deeply."_

## General Questions

### What does KIMU stand for?
KIMU stands for "Keep It Minimal UI" - a name that reflects the minimalist and intentional philosophy of the framework. KIMU embraces essentiality as a virtue and lightness as strength.

### Is KIMU suitable for commercial projects?
Absolutely! KIMU is released under an open source MPL-2.0 license that allows use in commercial projects. It is particularly well-suited for business dashboards, information kiosks, and applications that require lightness and performance.

### Why should I use KIMU instead of better-known frameworks?
KIMU offers a different approach: ultra-lightweight, modular, and focused on creative freedom. Choose KIMU when you value lightness, modularity, and expressiveness more than built-in functionality or ecosystem size.

### Is KIMU a complete framework?
KIMU doesn't aim to be an "everything included" framework, but rather an essential and modular toolkit that provides basic tools for building interfaces, leaving you the freedom to integrate what you need for your specific case.

## Philosophy and Concepts

### What do you mean by "poetic interfaces"?
Interfaces that are not just functional but also meaningful, elegant, intuitive - that communicate with the user in a fluid and natural way, like well-written verses. KIMU considers UI not just as a medium but as a message.

### How does minimalism work with complex projects?
KIMU's minimalism isn't limitation but focus. Modularity allows building complex systems by combining simple elements. Like in a zen garden, complexity emerges from the interaction of essential elements.

### Why do you emphasize the poetic and philosophical aspects so much?
We believe code is more than technical instructions: it's creative expression. KIMU's philosophical aspect isn't decorative but foundational - it guides technical decisions and helps create interfaces that have meaning beyond function.

### Is KIMU suitable for junior developers?
Yes, KIMU can be particularly formative for growing developers. Based on fundamental web standards without complex abstractions, KIMU encourages a deep understanding of core web concepts rather than learning framework-specific APIs.
