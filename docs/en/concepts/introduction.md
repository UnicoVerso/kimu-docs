# Welcome to KIMU

**KIMU** is a lightweight, minimal, and modular front-end framework for building **poetic** and **extensible** interfaces, based on **Web Components**, dependency-free, declarative and dynamic.

**KIMU** is more than a framework: it's a digital building philosophy, a toolbox for web artists. Born from the desire to create meaningful, light, and elegant digital spaces. For those who design with **intention**. For those who build with **care**. For those who seek **beauty** in simplicity.

> _Not just tools, but spaces._  
> _Not just components, but extensions of thought._  
> _Every interface is a gesture, every module a note._  
> _It doesn't impose: it accompanies. It doesn't shout: it breathes._  
> _Minimal in essence, infinite in possibilities._

## Why KIMU?

In an era of increasingly complex and constraining frameworks, **KIMU** offers an alternative and a radical vision: an ultra-minimal toolkit that sets you free and embraces web native standards.

Our mission is to enable you to:
- Build with **intention**, not with bloat
- Create interfaces that **breathe**
- Maintain complete control over your **architecture**
- Express your **creativity** without limits

> _"KIMU is a space where simplicity meets expressiveness,_  
> _where every line of code is a verse of digital poetry."_
