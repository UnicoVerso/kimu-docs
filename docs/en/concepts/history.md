# Project History

## Origins
KIMU was born from the desire to create a minimal and expressive UI framework, focused on essentiality and creative freedom: a digital space where technology can breathe and simplicity is a conscious choice.

> _"KIMU was born from the silence of code,_  
> _where structure breathes,_  
> _where gestures become experiences."_'

## Main Milestones
- Initial idea and philosophy (2024)
- First core engine prototype (2024)
- Modular extension system and asset management
- First public release and Minimal demo (2025)
- Ongoing development: documentation, playground, CLI, and more
