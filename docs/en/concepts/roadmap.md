# Roadmap

> _"Each step in KIMU's journey is a verse in its digital poetry,  
> each milestone a chapter in its story of intentional evolution."_

KIMU's roadmap isn't just a list of features, but a path of organic and conscious growth. Like a zen garden that develops with care and intention, each element is added with a clear purpose, maintaining the balance between simplicity and expressiveness.

## âœ… Completed

These are the foundations on which KIMU was built, the roots of our digital garden:

- [x] Core engine, the beating heart, minimalist yet powerful
- [x] Extension system, the ability to grow and adapt organically
- [x] Asset management, the harmony of resources and components
- [x] Manifest loader, the breath that gives life to the application
- [x] Minimal demo, the first visible sprout
- [x] Initial documentation, the first verses of our technical poetry
- [x] Build tools, the tools of our digital zen garden

## ðŸš§ In development

We are now working to make KIMU bloom in new directions, always maintaining coherence with its essence:

- [ ] Complete documentation, because knowledge is creative freedom
- [ ] Visual playground, a space to experiment, play, create
- [ ] CLI for extension generation, poetic tools to extend possibilities
- [ ] Design system, visual harmony that supports expression
- [ ] Module and service management, orchestration of the minimal ecosystem
- [ ] Communication between extensions, the dialogue that creates meaning
- [ ] Authentication, trust as a founding element
- [ ] New demo extensions, concrete inspirations for future possibilities
- [ ] Advanced i18n, interfaces that speak the language of the heart

## ðŸ’¡ Future ideas

These are the dreams that guide our path, the stars that orient our navigation:

- npm publication, making KIMU accessible in the JavaScript ecosystem
- Extension marketplace, a community of creators sharing extensions
- Offline support, freedom from constant connection
- Runtime themes, interfaces that breathe and transform
- Optional SSR, speed and accessibility for those who need it
- Visual editor export, from vision to code with a gesture
