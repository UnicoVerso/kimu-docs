# KIMU Concepts

**Welcome to the mind and soul of KIMU!**

Here you'll find not just technology, but ideas, vision, and values that inspire every line of code.

KIMU was born for those who want to build digital spaces that are poetic, essential, and free. A framework that puts creativity, lightness, and modularity at the centerâ€”for those who seek beauty and meaning in the web.

Our **mission**? To offer tools that don't impose limits, but open up possibilities. Our **vision**? A web where every interface is a gesture, every extension a note, every project a unique experience. Our **values**? Simplicity, openness, community, and respect for the essential.

Want to discover what makes KIMU different?  
You're in the right place!

In this section you'll find the philosophy, manifesto, history, use cases, and the differences with other frameworks. Every page is designed to intrigue you and invite you to explore the heart of the project.

**Get inspired, start your journey!**
