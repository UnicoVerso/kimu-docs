# Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns in KIMU provide proven solutions for recurring problems in developing modular and extensible applications.

## Overview

The patterns implemented in KIMU follow established software engineering principles, adapted to the specific needs of a framework based on Web Components and modular architecture.

## Fundamental Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
Ensures a single instance of critical components like stores and managers.

### Observer Pattern  
Implements an event system for communication between components.

### Module Pattern
Organizes code into independent and reusable modules.

### Factory Pattern
Creates instances of extensions and components in a controlled manner.

### Strategy Pattern
Allows changing algorithms and behaviors at runtime.

## KIMU-Specific Patterns

### Extension Pattern
The base pattern for creating modular and composable extensions.

### Asset Loading Pattern
Efficient management and lazy loading of application assets.

### State Management Pattern
Centralized state management with reactivity.

### Component Composition Pattern
Composition of complex components from simpler elements.

## Documentation Structure

Each pattern is documented with:

- **Problem**: What problem it solves
- **Solution**: How the pattern solves it
- **Implementation**: Example code in KIMU
- **Advantages**: Benefits of usage
- **Disadvantages**: Limitations and trade-offs
- **Use Cases**: When to use it
- **Variants**: Different implementations
- **Examples**: Real-world usage cases

## Available Patterns

### [Singleton Pattern](./singleton-pattern.md)
Management of unique instances for framework managers and stores.

### [Observer Pattern](./observer-pattern.md)
Event and notification system for communication between components.

### [Asset Loading Pattern](./asset-loading.md)
Efficient management of resource loading.

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Implementations are substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Specific and focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies towards abstractions

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Code reuse through patterns and abstraction.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Simple and understandable solutions.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Implementation only of necessary features.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### God Object
Avoid components that do too much.

### Tight Coupling
Maintain low coupling between components.

### Magic Numbers/Strings
Use named constants instead of hardcoded values.

### Deep Inheritance
Prefer composition over deep inheritance.

## Emerging Patterns

As the framework evolves, new patterns emerge specific to advanced use cases:

- **Micro-Frontend Pattern**
- **Progressive Enhancement Pattern**
- **Offline-First Pattern**
- **Performance Optimization Pattern**

## Practical Usage

Patterns are not rigid rules but flexible guidelines. The goal is:

1. **Consistency**: Uniform and predictable code
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to maintain and extend
3. **Reusability**: Reusable components
4. **Testability**: Easily testable code
5. **Performance**: Efficient solutions

## Combination Examples

Often patterns combine for more complete solutions:

```typescript
// Combination: Singleton + Observer + Factory
export class ExtensionManager {
  private static instance: ExtensionManager;
  private observers: Observer[] = [];
  private factory: ExtensionFactory;

  static getInstance(): ExtensionManager {
    if (!ExtensionManager.instance) {
      ExtensionManager.instance = new ExtensionManager();
    }
    return ExtensionManager.instance;
  }

  private constructor() {
    this.factory = new ExtensionFactory();
  }

  createExtension(type: string, config: any) {
    const extension = this.factory.create(type, config);
    this.notifyObservers('extension-created', extension);
    return extension;
  }
}
```
