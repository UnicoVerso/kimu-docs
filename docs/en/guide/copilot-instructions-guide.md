# Guide to using copilot-instructions.md in kimu-core

This guide explains what the `copilot-instructions.md` file is, how to integrate it into the kimu-core project, how it is used by AI agents (such as GitHub Copilot), and best practices to keep it effective.

## What is copilot-instructions.md

`copilot-instructions.md` is an instructions file located in the `.github` folder of the kimu-core project. It contains rules, conventions, examples, and best practices that guide Copilot and other AI agents in generating code that complies with the framework standards.

## Purpose of the file
- Provide an authoritative source of rules and conventions for kimu-core development.
- Improve the quality and consistency of code generated by AI agents.
- Facilitate onboarding of new contributors.

## Where to place it
The file must be placed in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at the root of the kimu-core project.

## How Copilot and AI agents use it
- Copilot and AI agents automatically read the file if present in the `.github` folder.
- The instructions are applied during code generation, suggestions, and refactoring.
- You can mention the file in Copilot requests to get more precise results (e.g., "Follow the rules in copilot-instructions.md").

## Best practices for maintenance
- Regularly update the file with new rules, examples, and conventions.
- Document every new feature, pattern, or important change.
- Keep the file clear, concise, and well-structured.
- Link other rule files such as `CODE_GUIDELINES.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.

## Usage examples
> "Create a new extension following the rules in copilot-instructions.md."
> "How do you integrate Three.js according to copilot-instructions.md?"

## FAQ
**Q: Do I need to manually train Copilot?**
A: No, just make sure the file is present and up to date. Copilot uses it automatically.

**Q: Can I use the file with other AI agents?**
A: Yes, any AI agent that supports instruction files can read and apply the rules.

**Q: Where can I find practical examples?**
A: In the file itself and in the extension documentation.

## Troubleshooting
- If Copilot does not follow the rules, check that the file is up to date and well-structured.
- Specify in your requests that it should follow the instructions in the file.
