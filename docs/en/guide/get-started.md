  Recommended: **LTS version** (â‰¥ 18.x)  
  This also includes `npm`, the Node.js package manager

  Install locally with:

  ```
  Or install globally with:

  ```

- (Optional) [**Python 3.x**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) â€“ used for the `py-server` script to quickly serve static files from the `dist` directory:

  python3 -m http.server 5173 --directory ./dist
  ```
  
ðŸ’¡ You can verify the installation by running:
