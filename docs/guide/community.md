# 💌 Share your thoughts

KIMU is a project built with care, shaped by intention, and carried forward with passion.

If you've used it, explored it, or even just glanced at it — say something.  
A thought, a suggestion, a kind word, or a simple “hello”.

Every message is a beam of light.  
Every word might spark a new extension.  
Every gesture helps fuel this journey.

📬 Send me a message, even just to say *"I see you. Keep going."*
